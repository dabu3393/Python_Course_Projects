This project requires you to write your code on the Reeborg's World website.

The goal is to get the robot to reach the finish line. The code in this file has commands and conditions already defined through Reeborg.

The Reeborg+World+Tests folder contains worlds or placements of the robot on the map that can be used to debug certain situations. To load those worlds, press Additional options and click the open world from file button to load these situations.
